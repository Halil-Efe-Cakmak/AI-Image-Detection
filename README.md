# AI-Image-Detection
A comprehensive AI-based image detection project using both traditional machine learning classifiers and transfer learning methods with pretrained CNN models.

This repository contains two sub-projects focused on image classification. The first project uses traditional machine learning algorithms (such as SVM, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, etc.) combined with handcrafted feature extraction techniques. The second project applies transfer learning with deep learning models (such as ResNet50) for more robust and scalable image detection. The dataset includes labeled "real" and "fake" images, and the pipeline covers all steps from preprocessing, feature extraction, training, evaluation, to model serialization.
